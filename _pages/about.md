I am a doctoral candidate in Economics at the **University of Massachusetts Amherst**, working at the intersection of **political economy, economic history, history of economic thought, and macroeconomics**.  

My dissertation develops this framework through a comparative analysis of Chile and the United States across the Fordist era, combining formal modeling, historiography, and applied econometrics. Drawing on comparative-historical political economy, I study how **institutions, technology, and distribution co-determine the long-run dynamics of capitalist development and state formation** in both countries incorporating a relational center-periphery dimension to comparative-historical analysis. 

 I am also currently diving into the field of  **political economy of law**, exploring the hierarchical networks of the repressive apparatuses of the state (RSA) that excercise state terrorism during the civic-military dictatorship in Chile (1973-1990), and the enduring legacies of poor institutional accountability and 

Together, these projects aim to explain how capitalist and state dynamics interwoven how social formations accumulate, institutions adapt, and power reproduces itself across the economic and juridical architectures of modern societies.  
Future research will broaden its temporality towards the post-fordist period, and its comparative horizon to other southern-cone countries, tracing the historical and institutional diversity of Latin American development. 

## Dissertation Research

My dissertation, *Essays on Chile and the United States in *Comparative-Relational Perspective*, develops a demand-led, comparative political economy of capitalist development across the Fordist era. It formalizes how capacity utilization, income distribution, and institutionally conditioned technological change, co-evolve to shape accumulation and crisis. Assuming that elasticity of productive capacities to accumulatioin of capital is not one, the link between accumulation and productive capacities becomes unbalanced, configurating distinct **accumulation regimes**‚ stagnation tendencies, cyclical crises, and accumulation-regime breakdowns that require institutional and technological reconfigurations - without necessarily finding one. 

The project combines **theoretical modeling, historical analysis, and applied econometrics**. It builds center-consistent measures of capital productivity and capacity utilization; estimates profitability decompositions for the United States and Chile, estimates investment functions; and re-visits the debate on the rise and fall of the **Unidad Popular**, the socialist coalition led by Salvador Allende during the 1970-1973. Understanding the revolutionary period of Chilean history as a critical juncture of world history amidst the global transition from Fordism to post-Fordism. My last chapter present new empirical evidence on how the Keynesian Military Stimulus of the U.S. conditioned the articulation of the external constraint with domestic class conflict. Overall, the dissertation advances a comparative-relational approach to study capitalist dynamics, connecting macroeconomic instability to the historical transformation of accumulation regimes at global scale.

## Job Market Paper 

- *Demand and Accumulation in Long-Run Capitalist Development: Unbalanced Growth and
Crisis* 
  + Develops a formal model of capitalist accumulation under persistent technological imbalance, integrating classical and post-Keynesian traditions to show how the feedback of capital accumulation into economic capacities creation determines dynamic stability in the long run.
  + Identifies crisis as an endogenous regime outcome, demonstrating how persistent unbalanced growth and accumulation-demand dynamics generate distinct domains of instability, providing a taxonomy distinguishing stagnation, partial crisis, and regime crisis.

## New Projects

Alongside my dissertation, I am developing a second research line on **Restorative Justice and the Political Economy of Law**, focused on how coercive institutions reproduce power through legality. It examines how legal and administrative systems preserve coercive power beyond formal regime change, studying the (RSA) during the Chilean dictatorship and its institutional persistence in political and civil society. Rather than treating repression as a deviation from legality, this emergent research conceives the legal order itself as a **material infrastructure of coercion and hierarchy**, a mechanism through which the State organized State Terrorism through networks of knowledge, distributing responsibilities, and allocating authority through hierarchical networks to implement State terrorism. Under this lenses, is plausible to look at the institutional persistence of the civic-militar dictatorship through both 

Using web-scrapping of digitalized archives, and network analysis, I map the civilÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“military circuits that enabled surveillance, disappearance, and impunity, tracing how these forms of control persisted within democratic institutions. The project approaches the lack of accountability for state crimes, a structural property of power relations, not only a moral demand or post-conflict procedure.  By linking the topology of repression to the architecture of law, it seeks to clarify how a societyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s institutional memory can either sustain or dismantle the own conditions that made systematic violence possible.

## Ongoing Projects 

- _The Ideological Embeddedness of Macroeconomic Indexes_ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â **Paper Submited for Review.**
  + Traces how U.S. capacity-utilization metrics shifted from a Keynesian tool to mobilize slack under Fordism to an inflation sentinel in the 1970s, showing that utilization measures were institutionally constructed in symbiotic interest of _Monopoly Capital_ and the State.
  + Reframes American Keynesianism as government-by-numbers, documenting how survey-based indices crowded out physical measures (EMU, AWW), and argues for plural, transparent indicators to reopen the policy dashboard to democratic contestation amid neoliberal technocratic closure.

- *Reconstructing Capital-Stocks for Chile, Dataset & Methods Paper.*
  + Reconstructs Chile gross and net capital stocks (1901-1994) in a stock-flow consistent framework, harmonizing Hofman, Clio-Lab, Díaz-Wagner, Tafunell-Ducoing, and Peréz-Eyzaguirre to deliver sectoral series plus implicit depreciation and z (depletion).
  + Establishes a reproducible baseline for profitability and capacity studies, validating identities and documenting sectoral patterns of implicit yearly depreciation and depletion of scrapping capital for validity of the harmonization.

## Teaching and Mentorship

I have taught or assisted at **UMass Amherst**, **Wesleyan University**, **Amherst College**, **Universidad de Santiago de Chile**, and **Universidad de Chile**, covering topics from _Macroeconomics_ and _Economic Development_ to _Political Economy of Latin American Development_ and _Social History of Chile_. 

I have mentored undergraduate and graduate theses on issues such as corruption, gender equity, and distributive conflict, with advisees later entering programs at **Columbia**, **Fordham**, and **USACH**.
