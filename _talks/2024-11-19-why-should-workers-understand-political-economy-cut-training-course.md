The three blocks offer a worker-centered introduction to political economy that moves from critique, to macro dynamics, to strategy. Block 1 demystifies “neutral” economic talk by mapping class fractions (industrial, financial, commercial) and showing how expert discourse operates as an intelligence apparatus for hegemony; participants practice decoding frames such as fiscal austerity and labor “flexibility” and discuss who benefits from them. Block 2 links distribution and growth, highlighting wage–profit conflict, the demand–employment nexus across the cycle, crisis dynamics, the reserve army, and structural change via automation and digitalization; the takeaway is how income shares shape employment and how crises reorganize labor markets and bargaining power. Block 3 reframes unions as organic intellectuals capable of translating and contesting dominant narratives, building solidarity across divisions, and designing strategies that regulate distributive conflict in society-wide terms; a collective exercise consolidates proposals for action. Together, the sequence equips workers to identify who gains from policy proposals, anticipate employment effects over the cycle, and replace competitive fragmentation with organized collective power.
