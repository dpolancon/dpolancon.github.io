This talk reconstructs Chile's Fordist-era labour regime as a dependent adaptation shaped by the legacy of inquilinaje and urban paternalism. Working within labour-process theory, it traces how territorial discipline and a social wage combined to foster both workplace consent and grassroots organizing. Comparative contrasts with Atlantic Fordism highlight balance-of-payments constraints, disarticulated industrialization, and over-urbanization, culminating in the 1970-1973 crisis when nationalizations met a wave of strikes and external pressures.
