Joan Robinson occupies a peculiar position in twentieth-century economic thought. She is widely cited, frequently invoked, and often celebrated as a founding figure of heterodox economics. Yet she is just as often domesticated: reduced to a Keynesian popularizer, a critic of neoclassical capital theory, or a transitional figure on the road from Marshall to Sraffa. What tends to disappear in these readings is Robinson’s deeper intellectual project: a sustained attempt to confront the internal incompatibilities of Cambridge economics. That confrontation never yielded a synthesis, and this was not accidental.

This post grows out of a presentation by Maria Cristina Marcuzzo at the Historical and Political Economy Workshop at UMass Amherst, and my role as discussant. Marcuzzo’s reconstruction is exemplary in one decisive respect: Robinson appears not as a sequence of contributions, but as a theorist whose trajectory exposes unresolved tensions in the Cambridge tradition. What follows is not a summary of that reconstruction, but a diagnosis prompted by it.

## Two Cambridges

Robinson’s work unfolded at the intersection of two traditions that coexisted uneasily in Cambridge. On one side stood the Marshall–Keynes line: demand, short-period analysis, uncertainty, and later Kalecki’s theory of pricing and employment. On the other stood the revival of classical political economy initiated by Sraffa: surplus, technique, distribution, and the critique of marginal productivity and capital measurement.

Robinson repeatedly tried to hold these traditions together. She moved from imperfect competition, to Keynesian long-period accumulation, to an explicitly plural Post-Keynesian programme drawing on Ricardo, Marx, Keynes, Kalecki, and Sraffa. Each move sought integration, and each ran into limits. The question is why those limits proved structural rather than contingent.

## Incompatibility, not delay

A charitable reading treats Robinson’s project as unfinished in a contingent sense: more time, different institutional conditions, a more receptive discipline. That interpretation misses the point. The obstacle was not incompleteness but incompatibility.

Once Sraffa’s critique of Marshall is taken seriously, the Marshallian apparatus cannot serve as the foundation for a general theory of prices or competition. This is not a dispute over realism versus abstraction. It is a matter of logical coherence. Marshallian supply-and-demand reasoning relies on separable cost and demand conditions, an assumption that collapses once production is treated as a system of interdependent techniques.

Robinson never fully abandoned Marshallian language, even as she increasingly rejected equilibrium reasoning. This ambivalence was not incidental. It repeatedly blocked a plausible synthesis (later pursued, in different ways, by figures like Garegnani and Pasinetti). Her work oscillates between extending equilibrium analysis and dissolving it, between preserving Marshall and undermining him. That oscillation is not a personal inconsistency. It is a fault line in economic theory.

## A division of labour she resisted

From a contemporary standpoint, a neat division of theoretical labour suggests itself. Long-period prices and distribution are coherently treated within Sraffa’s surplus framework. Activity levels, instability, and dynamics require the Keynes–Kalecki logic of effective demand, monetary production, and uncertainty. Marshall becomes historically informative but analytically redundant.

Many heterodox frameworks now operate with this separation, often implicitly. Robinson resisted it, not out of confusion, but out of principle. She rejected theories that achieved internal consistency by evacuating historical time, a commitment that also shaped her engagement with Marx.

## Marx, reproduction, and historical time

Robinson rejected Marx’s theory of value insofar as it was treated as a theory of relative prices, and she dismissed the “transformation problem” as a dead end. On that narrow issue, she was likely right: proportionality between labour values and prices is not the core explanatory payoff of Marxian theory.

Where Robinson was sharper was in her insistence on reproduction and historical time. Once capitalist reproduction is analysed in historical rather than logical time, smooth accumulation stops being the norm. Balanced reproduction requires restrictive conditions. Relax those conditions and disequilibrium becomes structural: demand is politically managed, exports operate as an autonomous component of demand, and distribution is shaped by institutional conflict.

That point should matter more than it currently does, because a lot of macroeconomics and development economics still smuggle stability in through the back door: as if the “long run” were a neutral space where conflict fades, rather than a horizon where conflict reorganizes the constraints of reproduction.

## Value theory after rent

Robinson’s rejection of value theory as a theory of relative prices is often taken to justify abandoning it altogether. That conclusion is too quick. The relevant question is not whether value theory “failed,” but what changed in the historical conditions under which price formation and surplus allocation operate.

One plausible explanation lies in the growth of rent-like mediation. Financialization redistributes surplus toward rentier and unproductive activities, altering the mapping between production and prices and weakening the informational content of profitability for accumulation.

A parallel distortion operates in resource-intensive and peripheral economies through ground rent, not finance alone. Commodity booms, localization rents, and control over natural resources inflate observed profitability without a corresponding transformation of productive capacity. Prices track scarcity, geopolitics, or ownership claims over land and subsoil assets rather than socially necessary labour time.

In both cases, value–price regularities weaken not because value theory loses relevance, but because surplus is increasingly mediated by rent extraction. Financial rent and ground rent are distinct mechanisms, but structurally homologous: both reallocate surplus away from productive reproduction and distort the signals that profitability sends to accumulation.

## An unfinished project that remains operative

Robinson described Post-Keynesian economics not as a finished theory but as a project to be accomplished, one that would require disentangling logical coherence from ideological comfort, something mainstream economics systematically avoids.

The lesson of her work is not that Cambridge economics failed to cohere. It is that some forms of coherence are illusory. The tensions between surplus and demand, equilibrium and historical time, and logical comparison and real-time processes cannot be resolved by synthesis alone.

That tension continues to structure contemporary debates in political economy. Robinson’s “unfinished” project is not a historical curiosity. It is a diagnosis that still bites.
